## Intro

This repository contains the code of an eCommerce website that has multiple functionalities like adding to cart, searching the products, user registration and login, adding comments on a post, sending email via a contact and newsletter form.

The app uses the MySQL and MongoDB databases at the same time. It uses MongoDB to store the data in a cloud server while MySQL is used for local storage. The app also uses the JSON Web Token(JWT) to authenticate a user. It generates, stores and deletes a token in a cookie while Redis is used to store the credentials and token in a cache memory.

The front-end design of this application is taken from [WP THEMES GRID](https://www.wpthemesgrid.com) while the backend is completely written in Golang. Both frontend and backend are written in Golang, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## App Structure

The app structure follows **MVC architecture**. The application contains seven parent directories and five subdirectories in which controllers, products data, database, JavaScript, HTML and CSS templates are written separately. The parent directories are.

- **controllers**: This directory contains 16 files. All of them handle different functionalities for different templates, like calling the templates, generating the JWT tokens, handling blogs, sending email, CRUD functionality, converting passwords into hash values, etc.
    
- **database**: This directory contains 3 subdirectories `mongodb`, `mysql` and `redis`. The first subdirectory contains the MongoDB database files that will connect, insert and find the data. The second subdirectory will do the same thing but in MySQL database. The third subdirectory contains the redis files that will set, get and delete the values.
    
- **middleware**: This directory has one file `middleware.go`. It handles the errors in most of the functions and loading the environment variables.
   
- **models**: This directory has one file `models.go`. It contains multiple structures related to multiple functionalities.

- **products**: This directory has two files `data.csv` and `product-access.go`. The first file stores the product data in a CSV file. The second file performs the functionality to access that data. 

- **routes**: This directory has one file `routes.go`. It handles the paths that will be visited and uses middleware to check for errors.

- **views**: This directory contains two subdirectories **templates** and **static**. The first subdirectory contains all the HTML files. The second subdirectory contains all the JavaScript, CSS, images and fonts also.

- **.gitignore**: It contains all the files that should be ignored.
- **main.go**: It calls the routes and uses a port to run an app.
- **go.mod**: It stores the golang dependencies. It will be generated by using ```go mod init```
